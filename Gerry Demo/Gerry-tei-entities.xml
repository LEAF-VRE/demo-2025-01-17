            <head><persName key="Elbridge Gerry" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q219797">Elbridge Gerry</persName>.</head>
            <p>The son of <persName key="Thomas Gerry" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96217015">Thomas Gerry</persName>, a native of <placeName>Newton,
                  England</placeName>, but emigrated to this country in <date>1730</date>, was born
               at <placeName key="Marblehead" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q27416">Marblehead, Massachusetts</placeName>, the <date>17th of July
                  1744</date>. He entered <orgName>Harvard college</orgName> before he was fourteen
               years of age, &amp; graduated there in <date>1762</date>. He was at first destined to
               the profession of medicine, to which he was strongly attached; but soon after he left
               college he engaged in the same business his father followed &amp; at his request,
               that of a merchant; &amp; for sometime attended the routine of mercantile pursuits in
               his native town. The knowlege he acquired of commerce &amp; the modes of transacting
               that branch of business was useful to him in future life.</p>

            <p>The strong political excitements of the times attracted his attention from the
               compting house, tho for the time he was successful, &amp; terminated his connection
               with commerce, to which he had little partiality. In the intervals of public
               employment he did indeed resume the avocation, but as might be expected, when not
               steadily pursued with no great satisfaction or advantage; &amp; after a few years he
               finally abandoned it for other objects more congenial to his mind.</p>

            <p>He made his first appearance in public life as a representative of his native town in
                  <date>May 1772</date>-a period when the royal government &amp; people were in a
               high state of acrimony &amp; almost open collision. The next year he was re-elected,
               &amp; tho one of the youngest members, was appointed a member of the standing
               committee of correspondence &amp; enquiry with the other colonies; &amp; of the
               committee to prepare an address to the provinces. He was distinguished for his zeal
               &amp; firmness in support of the rights of his country. His spirit was nourished by
               close communion with the <orgName>Adamses</orgName>, the
                  <orgName>Hancocks</orgName>, &amp; the <orgName>Warrens</orgName> of those
               days.</p>

            <p>In <date>1774</date>, in consequence of difficulties which arose in
                  <placeName>Marblehead</placeName> on account of the small pox, he declined a
               re-election to the legislature. But in <date>October</date> he was elected member of
               an assembly which met at <placeName>Salem</placeName>, &amp; adjourned to
                  <placeName>Concord</placeName>, where they assumed the form of a legislative
               assembly under the name of the provincial congress.</p>

            <p>In <date>1775</date> he was a member of the provincial congress of
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> which virtually destroyed the royal authority
               in that province. He was chairman of the committee of supplies to provide ammunition
               &amp; provisions, &amp; to deposit them in some place of safety for future use. This
               trust he executed with great punctuality &amp; unwearied industry. On the <date>18th
                  of April</date> the British troops on their march to
                  <placeName>Lexington</placeName>, in the middle of the night, passed the house in
               which the committee held their session. After the foremost of the troops passed,
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> from his bed saw a portion of them preparing to
               surround the house, he sprang from his bed, &amp; half dressed escaped undiscovered
               &amp; concealed himself in a cornfield, till the troops entered &amp; searched the
               house &amp; bed chambers, and joined the main body &amp; marched off;
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> then returned, &amp; tho his bed had been rumpled, he
               found his clothing &amp; watch safe.</p>

            <p>Being ardent &amp; persevering in his measures to oppose the public enemy, early in
                  <date>November</date> he proposed that the provincial congress should raise a
               committee upon the subject of fitting out armed vessels &amp; establishing a court
               for the trial &amp; condemnation of assizes. The committee was appointed, a bill
               reported, &amp; passed; &amp; soon after the council appointed him, under the
               authority of that Act, maritime judge for the counties of
                  <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, <placeName>Middlesex</placeName>, &amp;
                  <placeName>Essex</placeName>; but thinking he could be more useful as a legislator
               &amp; preferring it to that of a judge, he declined the appointment.</p>

            <p>On the <date>18th of January 1776</date> he was elected a delegate to the general
               congress, &amp; on the <date>9th of February</date> following took his seat, &amp;
               continued such under other elections till the <date>5th of July 1780</date>. As a
               delegate he was constantly attentive, active, industrious, exact, &amp; tenacious of
               public &amp; private honor, &amp; rendered great service to the nation. He was a
               zealous &amp; able advocate for the independence of this country, &amp; signed the
               declaration of it. From his first entrance into congress, till the organization of
               the treasury board in <date>1780</date>, he continued to be a member, &amp; generally
               chairman of the committee of the treasury. In his capacity of presiding officer of
               the board of the treasury, he rendered himself particularly invidious to general
                  <persName key="Benedict Arnold" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q298237">Arnold</persName>, whose extravagant accounts he rejected with a spirit
               which deserves admiration, as <persName>Arnold</persName> was then known only as a
               gallant soldier, whose skill &amp; courage had been conspicuously exerted for his
               country, &amp; the liberality with which such talents &amp; activity were then
               promptly rewarded, inclined men to a favorable consideration of his claim.</p>

            <p>To <persName>Arnold</persName>'s abusive appeal to congress, for he appealed there,
               Mr <persName>Gerry</persName> replied, and after exhibiting with great calmness the
               reasons of his decisions on his accounts, concluded with a severe reprehension of the
               conduct of his assailant. "If," said he, "the faithful discharge of our official
               duty, unpleasant enough in itself, is to bring with it the liability of personal
               attack of men who have neither honesty in their public dealings nor curtesy in
               private life, it might be well to abolish all guards on the treasury, &amp; admit
               rapacity &amp; crime to help themselves at pleasure." This was intrepid language at
               the period, &amp; must be sound doctrine at all times.</p>

            <p>On the <date>14th of January 1778</date>, in a letter to a friend, he says, "I am
               worn down with fatigue, &amp; have been waiting with some impatience to return to
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>; but I have wished to see certain measures
               accomplished before I left congress; when those were finished, others presented
               themselves equally important &amp; I waited for them, &amp; so on; but this mode of
               travelling will never get me home. I must therefore determine at all events to leave
               this place in the spring." The <date>24th of April</date> he says, "I wish to see a
               return of some of my colleagues, in order to obtain such relaxation from business, as
               at length has become indispenably necessary for preserving my health. Two years
               constant attention to the business of congress &amp; the board of the treasury, the
               members of which have been unequal in number to the duties required, with opportunity
               for very little exercise, is rather hazardous to the constitution, &amp; I feel the
               effects of it." The <date>26th of May</date> he says, "I had before this thot to have
               set off for <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, but have not been able to break
               away from the incessant labors which occupy me day &amp; night much of this time
               &amp; close application was devoted to forming &amp; vindicating the articles of
               confederation between the States." Near the close of <date>1779</date> he was
               appointed at the head of the committee chosen by <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>
               to meet delegates from other states at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, to devise
               a corrective for the deplorable state of the paper currency.</p>

            <p>On the <date>19th of February 1780</date>, upon the question of proportioning
               supplies to be furnished by the several states &amp; the value of them, he moved that
               the prices should conform to those agreed upon by a convention previously held at
                  <placeName>New Haven</placeName>. This motion was objected to as being out of
               order; on the question of order, he requested the yeas &amp; nays, but congress
               refused to record them. This course he considered improper &amp; injurious to
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, who he thot was required to contribute more
               then her equal proportion to the common cause. He therefore on the <date>5th
                  July</date> left congress where he had devoted, without recess or intermission
               four years &amp; a half to his official labors for which he received about four
               thousand dollars specie value.</p>

            <p>Soon after his return to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, he made his complaint
               to their general assembly; the house approved of his conduct, &amp; voted to sustain
               his complaint but the council probably thinking the opinion expressed by the popular
               branch would answer all the purposes proposed by the measure let the resolve lie on
               the table. This course did not satisfy Mr <persName>Gerry</persName>. In
                  <date>November</date> he was re-elected delegate to congress, but declined the
               appointment, assigning as a reason that the rights &amp; prerogatives of the state
               had been invaded in his person, &amp; no redress had on his own application, &amp; no
               demand had been made by his constituents. The court resolved that they approved of
               the high sense which he had of his right of priviledge, and instructed their
               delegates to make such representation to congress as the importance of the subject
               required. Their delegates accordingly presented a remonstrance &amp; protest against
               the proceedings of congress, which was placed in their files. Tho Mr
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> was absent, congress appointed him a member of the
               committee to visit the army.</p>

            <p>On the <date>31st of January 1781</date> he was elected a member of the
                  <orgName>American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences</orgName>. In
                  <date>October</date> he was elected a representative by the inhabitants of
                  <placeName>Marblehead</placeName>, &amp; a senator by the county of
                  <placeName>Essex</placeName>, to the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>
               legitature. The office of senator he declined, but that of representative he
               accepted. In <date>April 1782</date> he was again elected senator, but again declined
               the office.</p>

            <p>The <date>21st of June 1781</date> he was again elected a delegate to the congress of
               the <placeName>United States</placeName>; but the controversy which induced him to
               leave congress the preceeding year not being settled, nor such measures adopted by
               the State in relation to it as he thot satisfactory, he formally declined the
               appointment; but the legislature did not accept his decline. In <date>June
                  1782</date> the legislature re-appointed him delegate to congress; &amp; in
                  <date>June 1783</date> they again re-appointed him. Yielding to the solicitations
               of personal &amp; political friends, &amp; satisfied at length with the measures
               which had been taken on his remonstrance, he resumed his seat in congress on the
                  <date>third of November</date> following, where he remained till some time in
                  <date>September 1785</date>, when he closed his career in the old congress. It is
               said that at the age of less than forty two years he had been longer a member of
               congress than any other man in it. He was opposed to the society of
                  <orgName>Cincinnati</orgName>-he considered it too aristocratical for our
               institutions, &amp; as having a tendency to introduce an order of nobility into the
               country.</p>

            <p>He preserved his habits of industry, &amp; close attention to every subject that was
               moved in congress; he transcribed with his own hands their public &amp; private
               proceedings during every day of his attendance. Congress appointed him one of the
               commissioners to settle with the contractors of the army; but he declined the
               appointment.</p>

            <p>Before he left congress, but after he was more than forty years old, he married a
               daughter of <persName>James Thompson</persName> of <placeName>New York</placeName>.
               By her he had a numerous family of children. She, and three sons, &amp; six daughters
               survived him.</p>

            <p>In <date>May 1785</date> he was elected a member of the Senate of
                  <placeName>Masachusetts</placeName>, but declined the office; observing he was
               elected a representative, which he intended to accept as soon as his term of delegate
               to congress should expire.</p>

            <p>In <date>1786</date> he was appointed by the legislature of
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> one of their delegates to meet delegates from
               the other States at <placeName>Annapolis</placeName> the first of
                  <date>September</date>, to consider the commerce of the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName>, &amp; how far a uniform system of commercial regulations was
               necessary, &amp; to report a bill upon the subject to congress. The delegates from
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> considered the plan too limited &amp;
               inefficient for the purpose, &amp; severally declined the appointments. At the
               meeting only five States attended at <placeName>Annapolis</placeName>; &amp; nothing
               was done, except recommending the States to appoint a convention to meet the next
               year at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>

            <p>The general court of <placeName>Masachusetts</placeName> appointed him a delegate to
               the convention, which met at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> &amp; formed the
               constitution of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. On the <date>29th of May
                  1787</date> he attended &amp; took part in the business and debates of that
               assembly; but having arrived at the conclusion in his own mind that it did not
               comport with the well being of the country, with regret. But without hesitation, he
               declined signing the constitution. In his letter of the <date>18th of October</date>
               following to the president of the Senate &amp; speaker of the house of
               representatives of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, he stated his objections to
               the constitution in a frank &amp; candid manner, addressed to their understanding,
               not their passions.</p>

            <p>"My principal objections," he says, "to the plan are, there is no adequate provision
               for a representation of the people; that they have no security for the right of
               election; that some of the legislature are ambiguous, &amp; others indefinite &amp;
               dangerous, that the executive is blended with, &amp; will have an undue influence
               over, the legislature; that the judicial departments will be oppressive; that
               treaties of the highest importance may be formed by the president with the advice of
               two thirds of a quorum of the Senate; &amp; that the system is without the security
               of a bill of rights." But in the conclusion he says, "I shall only add, that as the
               public welfare requires a better constitution than the confederation, I shall think
               it my duty, as a citizen of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, to support that
               which shall be finally adopted, sincerely hoping it will secure the liberty &amp;
               happiness of <placeName>America</placeName>."</p>

            <p>The convention of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, which met the <date>9th of
                  January 1788</date>, to decide the question whether they would ratify the
               constitution, on the <date>14th of that month</date> voted that Mr
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> "be requested to take a seat in the convention, to
               answer any questions of fact from time to time, that the convention may ask,
               respecting the passing of the constitution;" &amp; appointed a committee to request
               him to attend, &amp; he attended accordingly. On the <date>18th</date> the convention
               voted that his answers should be in writing; with which he complied. On the
                  <date>22nd</date> he wrote a long letter to the convention respecting the
               constitution; to which objections &amp; some pointed remarks were made; &amp; no
               further communications appear to have been made by him. His opposition to the
               constitution exposed him to the censure of many of his former political friends,
               &amp; to much abuse in the journals of the day. He felt severely the revulsion of
               public opinion, &amp; the loss of popularity. At the first election of
               representatives to congress under that constitution, he was brot forward as a
               candidate; but at the first meetings in <placeName>Middlesex</placeName> there was no
               choice, &amp; previous to the second his friends again named him.</p>

            <p>He then published, under his own signature, a manly address to the electors,
               requesting such of them as were disposed to vote for him to turn their attention to
               some other candidate explicitly declaring that an election would by no means be
               agreeable to him. After mentioning the unjust accusations &amp; abuse which had been
               heaped upon him, for acting according to his own judgment respecting the constitution
               of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, he says, "Some have endeavored to
               represent me as an enemy to the constitution; than which nothing is more remote from
               truth.</p>

            <p>Since the commencement of the revolution, I have been solicitous for an efficient
               federal government, conceiving that without it we must be a divided &amp; unhappy
               people. A government too democratical I have deprecated; but wished for one that
               possessed powers sufficient for the welfare of the union, &amp; at the same time so
               balanced as to secure the governed from the rapacity &amp; domination of lawless
               &amp; insolent ambition. To an unconstitutional ratification I was therefore opposed,
               because thereby every necessary amendment would be precarious. But as the system is
               adopted, I am clearly of opinion that every citizen of the ratifying States is in
               duty bound to support it, &amp; that an opposition to a due administration of it
               would not only be unjustifiable but highly criminal.</p>

            <p>"Amendments every citizen has a right to urge without enciting a spirit of
               prosecution, which is unnecessary in a good cause, &amp; never gains proselytes in a
               bad one. Every friend of a vigorous government, as I conceive, must be desirous of
               such amendments as will remove the just apprehensions of the people, &amp; secure
               their confidence &amp; affection. To defeat amendments of this description, must be
               in effect to defeat the constitution itself. When the question on amendments shall
               have received a constitutional decision; I shall cheerfully acquiese, &amp; in any
               event, shall be happy to promote the interests of the respectable county of
                  <placeName>Middlesex</placeName>, of this commonwealth, &amp; of the
                  <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

            <p>"The part, which I have had to act, &amp; the uncandid treatment, &amp; the which I
               have received in this matter will, I trust, justify me in being thus explicit, for I
               am conscious that every part of my political conduct has had for its object, the
               public welfare."</p>

            <p>At the second meeting he was elected by a small majority. In his letter of acceptance
               to the governor he says. "I am deeply impressed with the honorable testimony of the
               electors of <placeName>Middlesex</placeName>, after I had repeatedly informed them of
               my declining the appointments. This however has placed me in a situation, which of
               all others I wished to avoid; being thereby reduced to the disagreeable alternative
               of disappointing my fellow citizens; who have conferred on me their suffrages, or of
               filling a place, which the most cogent reasons had urged me to decline. Under these
               circumstances, in the critical state of public affairs, I have preferred the latter,
               being determined to sacrifice every personal consideration, to the acceptance of the
               office; that desirous as I am of the establishment of a federal government, no act of
               mine may have the least appearance of impeding it."</p>

            <p>To his confidential friends he wrote on this subject in the same strain; &amp; there
               is not the slightert reason to doubt the truth &amp; sincerty of his declaration.</p>

            <p>On the <date>8th of April 1789</date> he took his seat in congress. When some of the
               members were for considering the subject of amendements before they had passed the
               laws necessary to carry the new government into full effect, he opposed that object.
               In the course of debate he said, "I am of opinion that we should dispatch the
               important subjects now on the table, &amp; reserve the great questions concerning the
               constitution; to a period of tranquility &amp; leisure. It is indeed a momentuos
               subject, &amp; very near my heart, &amp; I shall be glad to set about it as speedily
               as possible; but I would not stay the operation of government on that account. I
               think our political ship should first be got under way, &amp; that she be not
               suffered to rot at the wharf, till she beats off her rudder, or runs a wreck on the
               shore. I wish an early day may be assigned for the consideration of amendments, to
               prevent the necessity, which the States may feel themselves under of calling a new
               convention. I am not one of those facinated admirers of the system who consider it
               all perfection; I am not so blind or so uncandid, that I cannot see, or will not
               acknowlege it has beauties. It partakes of humanity; there is blended in it virtue
               &amp; vice, excellence &amp; error. If it is referred to a new convention, we risk
               some of its best properties. My opinion was openly given, that it ought not to have
               been ratified without amendments, but as the matter now stands, I am firmly of
               opinion that the salvation of <placeName>America</placeName> depends on the
               establishment of this government, whether amended or not. If this constitution, which
               is now ratified, be not supported, I despair of ever having a government for these
                  <placeName>United States</placeName>."</p>

            <p>In <date>1791</date> he was re-elected a representative to congress, &amp; held the
               office till the <date>3d of March 1793</date>. Having served four years, he declined
               a re-election.</p>

            <p>In the years <date>1796</date> &amp; <date>1804</date> he was chosen an elector of
               president &amp; vice president of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

            <p>On the <date>22d of June 1797</date> he was appointed envoy extraordinary jointly
               with <persName>Pinkney</persName> &amp; <persName>Marshall</persName> to
                  <placeName>France</placeName>. Nothing could have been more unexpected to him than
               this appointment, which he reluctantly accepted; &amp; on the <date>9th of
                  August</date> following embarked for that country. On the <date>4th October</date>
               the thee envoys met in <placeName>Paris</placeName>, &amp; the next day announced
               their arrival to <persName>Talleyrand</persName> the minister of foreign affairs,
               &amp; requested an opportunity to present their letters of evidence. Three days after
               they had an interview with the minister, delivered the letters of evidence, &amp;
               received cards of hospitality.</p>

            <p>In a day or two the private &amp; confidential secretary of the minister intimated to
               the secretary of one of the envoys, that some part of the president's speech to
               congress required an explanation; &amp; that the envoys would not probably have an
               audience tell the negotiation was finished. Anonymous persons, afterwards designated
               by X.Y.&amp;Z, called upon the envoys, &amp; proposed that they should give a
               softening turn to the presidents speech; make a loan of some millions of money to the
               French treasury &amp; a gratuity of fifty thousand pounds sterling to certain high
               officers of government, for distribution to prominent individuals. The envoys
               promptly resolved they would not purchase the right of negotiation. It was intimated
               to Mr <persName>Gerry</persName> thot <persName>Talleyrand</persName> expected to
               have seen the American envoy &amp; to have conferred with them individually on the
               affairs of the mission. <persName>Gerry</persName> communicated the fact to
                  <persName>Pinkney</persName> &amp; <persName>Marshall</persName>; they advised him
               to call, but declined going themselves. He reluctantly consented, &amp; had several
               interviews with <persName>Tallyrand</persName>, at which they occasionally discussed
               the relations of the <placeName>United States</placeName> &amp;
                  <placeName>France</placeName>.</p>

            <p>After waiting thirty days, one of the envoys proposed to address the minister in an
               official note, requesting his attention to their situation, &amp; demanding that
               measures should be taken to open the negotiation. Mr <persName>Gerry</persName> was
               of opinion it would be useless; but signed with the other envoys a letter to the
               minister. To this letter no answer was returned; but they were given to understand it
               was laid before the executive directory, who would command their minister what steps
               to pursue. <persName>Talleyrand</persName> informed Mr <persName>Gerry</persName>
               that no treaty would be made with the envoys, without an apology for the presidents
               speech, or an equivalent; but that a voluntary offer of a loan would be accepted as
               an equivalent. In consequence of <persName>Gerry</persName>'s visit to
                  <persName>Talleyrand</persName>, the latter invited the former to one of his
               customary dinners, &amp; Mr <persName>Gerry</persName> afterwards returned the
               civility; but his separation from his colleagues was so unpleasant, that with a
               single exception he afterwards declined all personal attention to
                  <persName>Talleyrand</persName>. All three of the envoys signed a report to the
               government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, that there was no prospect of
               effecting the object of their mission, without the payment of a large sum of
               money.</p>

            <p>On the <date>4th of February 1798</date>, <persName>Talleyrand</persName> invited Mr
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> to call upon him; at their meeting
                  <persName>Talleyrand</persName>, after enjoining profound secrecy, informed
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> that the directory had determined not to treat with
                  <persName>Pinkney</persName> &amp; <persName>Marshall</persName> but were willing
               to commence negotiations with him. On the <date>27th of that month</date> the envoys
               demanded of <persName>Tallyrand</persName> an audience; &amp; on the <date>2d &amp;
                  6th of March</date> were admitted.</p>

            <p>He insisted on a loan. <persName>Pinkney</persName> and <persName>Marshall</persName>
               were decidedly against it; but <persName>Gerry</persName> appeared, at the
               conferences, silent on the subject. But when the envoys were together by themselves,
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> stated his opinion, that he thot a loan preferable to a
               war, &amp; was therefore willing to open negotiation upon the basis of a loan, &amp;
               when a treaty was formed not agree to it without the sanction of our government; but
               the other two envoys met the proposition with an unqualified negative. On the
                  <date>18th of that month</date>
               <persName>Talleyrand</persName> in an official letter to the envoys avows the opinion
               that the directory will not treat with the three envoys, but with one of them. The
               envoys not being accredited, but exposed to personal &amp; official mortifications of
               a humiliating kind, requested that letters of safe post should be granted to them
               individually or to such as they pleased. Letters were accordingly granted to
                  <persName>Pinkney</persName> &amp; <persName>Marshall</persName>, but not to
                  <persName>Gerry</persName>; &amp; the two former soon after embarked for the
                  <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

            <p>On the <date>3d of April</date>
               <persName>Talleyrand</persName> wrote <persName>Gerry</persName> that he believed the
               other two envoys had withdrawn from the French territories, &amp; expressed a desire
               to resume communications with him upon the interests of <placeName>France</placeName>
               &amp; the <placeName>United States</placeName>. The next day
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> informed him that as an individual he would confer, but
               the commission being jointly to three envoys, as a minister he had no authority. On
               the <date>20th</date> he wrote <persName>Talleyrand</persName>, That as his
               colleagues from necessity had left <placeName>Paris</placeName>; to prevent a rupture
               between the two nations he had consented to remain; but his conferences must be
               informal-&amp; that he should communicate them to his government, but without
               official authority. <persName>Talleyrand</persName> abandoned the demand of a loan,
               &amp; the explanation of the president's speech; and announced the willingness of the
               government to give Mr <persName>Gerry</persName> a public reception.</p>

            <p>On the <date>3d of May</date> Mr <persName>Gerry</persName> in a letter to Mr
                  <persName>King</persName> says, "I cannot say what will be the opinion of the
               president, or of his constitutients, respecting my conduct in remaining here, but I
               will do nothing that I cannot justify to my own mind, &amp; which I am not clearly
               convinced ought to merit their approbation. I have no personal views in remaining,
               &amp; the moment I can reconcile this government to my departure, I shall embark for
               the <placeName>United States</placeName>."</p>

            <p>The circumstance of his remaining in <placeName>France</placeName> after the other
               envoys had left it, &amp; the apprehension that he would do something that would
               compromit the honor or interest of our country, excited the people to censure him
               with great severity. To a gentleman who had forwarded to him, by express, the
               dispatches published in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, advising him to
               withdraw from <placeName>France</placeName> before their contents were made known
               &amp; urging the danger of his situation, he writes, "I have received your letter
               with copies of the dispatches enclosed. The prospect of a ten years' imprisonment
               would not induce me to quit this country as a fugitive." In his conferences with
                  <persName>Talleyrand</persName> he displayed talents, information, industry,
               prudence, &amp; uncompromising integrity. On the eve of hostilities between the two
               nations his zeal, his penetration, &amp; cool perseverance, laid the foundation for
               an accomodation. The minister having given him a positive assurance of the reception
               of another minister, with the respect due to the nation he should represent, he on
               the <date>10th of June</date> demanded his pass-ports; but the government of
                  <placeName>France</placeName>, under various pretents, delayed it till the
                  <date>26th of July</date>, when he left <placeName>Paris</placeName> for
                  <placeName>Havre</placeName>.</p>

            <p>There he received an arrete from the French government restraining the irregular
               &amp; vexatious conduct of privateers in the West Indian Seas &amp; assurances given
               that all other arrangements should conform to the just expectations of the
                  <placeName>United States</placeName>. The benefits which Mr
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> considered as resulting from his residence in that
               country was, an express renunciation on the part of <placeName>France</placeName> of
               loans; of reparation for the presidents speech; a renunciation of a demand for the
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> to assume debts due her citizens; a
               disclaimer of any desire that we should dissolve the British treaty; an admission of
               our claim for captures on the want of a role d'equipage; advances towards a new
               negotiation; &amp; the actual preservation of peace.</p>

            <p>On the <date>first day of October</date> he arrived at <placeName>Boston</placeName>;
               &amp; on the <date>18th of that month</date> in a letter to the secretary of State,
               giving an account of his mission says_ "I was informed that an immediate rupture
               would be the result of my departure from <placeName>France</placeName>; &amp; the
               same communication being again made, with information, that if I was determined not
               to negotiate seperately, this government would be satisfied with my residence here,
               untill the government of the <placeName>United States</placeName> could take their
               measures.</p>

            <p>I consented to this from public considerations solely; for every private one was
               opposed to it. In my embarrassed situation, not losing sight of the great object of
               our mission, a reconciliation with this powerful republic. I have taken a position,
               by which I meant to ascertain, if possible, without compromitting the government of
               the <placeName>United States</placeName>, or myself, the ultimate views of
                  <placeName>France</placeName> with respect to them. It would have been impossible
               for me under existing circumstances to have consented to a seperate negotiation, had
               the provision been made in our powers &amp; instructions: for two of my colleagues,
               one from the southern, &amp; the other from the middle states, having been sent back,
               I could have had no prospect of forming a treaty, which would have given general
               satisfaction to my country; &amp; I could never undertaken any negociation, without
               that prospect. It is therefore incumbent on me to declare, that should the result of
               my endeavors present to our government more pleasing prospects, it is nevertheless,
               my firm determination to proceed no further in this negotiation."</p>

            <p>Tho the mission was very unpleasant to each of the envoys, it was useful to the
                  <placeName>United States</placeName>-it opened a way for the termination of
               hostile feelings, &amp; the preservation of the peace &amp; honor of our country.
               President <persName>Adams</persName>, the elder, some years after says, Mr
                  <persName>Gerry</persName> "finally saved the peace of the nation, for he alone
               discovered &amp; furnished evidence that X.Y &amp;Z. were employed by
                  <persName>Talleyrand</persName>; &amp; he alone brot home the direct, formal,
               &amp; official assurances upon which the subsequent commission proceeded &amp; peace
               made." After his return from <placeName>France</placeName> a number of his friends
               were desirous that he should be candidate for representative to congress; but he
               positively declined it. In <date>April 1800</date> &amp; <date>1801</date> he was
               supported as candidate for governor of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, but the
               opposing candidate succeeded by a small majority: in the last of those years of
               45,816 votes <persName>Gerry</persName> had 20,169.</p>

            <p>He spent his time at his farm in <placeName>Cambridge</placeName> in philosophical
               retirement, attending to his favorite pursuits, the education of his children, &amp;
               the cultivation of his land. But in his retirement he was unfortunate. A friend for
               whom he had become surety for a large amount, failed, &amp; left him with a weight of
               pecuniary obligation, from which he was never able to extricate himself. Indeed, at
               his discease he left to his family only his example and his fame.</p>

            <p>Immediately after the attack made in <date>1808</date> by the British ship
                  <orgName>Leopard</orgName> upon the American frigate
               <orgName>Chesapeake</orgName>, there was a great meeting held in
                  <placeName>Boston</placeName> on the occasion. Mr <persName>Gerry</persName> being
               there, but not in the assembly, was appointed presiding officer. After being
               conducted to the chair, he observed "I had not anticipated that at my time of life,
               there could have been a scene like of the present, but I yield to the call that is
               made on me, as I hold it to be the duty of every citizen, tho he may not have but one
               day to live, to devote that day to his country.</p>

            <p>In <date>August 1810</date>
               <orgName>Harvard college</orgName> conferred on him the degree of doctor of laws; the
               people, in the preceeding <date>April</date>, having elected him governor of
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, on the duties of which he entered the
                  <date>2d of June</date>. In appointments to office, he respected the claims of his
               political friends whom he found to have been heretofore almost entirely excluded; but
               of the incumbents holding their place at the will of the executive, no one was
               disturbed in the enjoyment of his situation. A strong effort was made by influential
               individuals to change the governor's policy in this respect, &amp; there were not
               wanting those who expressed their dissatisfaction at the tolerance he was disposed to
               observe. But their disapprobation was without effect: his policy was to effect a
               conciliation between the people &amp; the administration of the government of the
                  <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

            <p>In <date>April 1811</date> he was re-elected governor. The opposition of the
               federalists of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, to the administration of the
               government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, had become not only active
               but violent. The governor in his speech, of the <date>7th of June</date>, to the
               legislature, speaking of the appointments he had made, says, "To diminish, &amp; if
               possible to exterminate party spirit, the executive of this commonwealth, during in
               the last year, has confirmed in his place, or re-appointed within or requisite, every
               state officer under his control, who has been correct in his conduct, &amp; faithful
               to his trust; disregarding his polities, &amp; requiring only his support of the
               federal &amp; state constitutions, governments &amp; laws, with a due regard to the
               rights of officers and individuals subject to his official discretion.</p>

            <p>But it cannot be expected of any executive, so far to disregard the sound obligations
               of duty &amp; honor, as to preserve in official stations such individuals as would
               abuse the influence of their public characters, by sanctioning resistance to laws, or
               by such other conduct as will beguile peaceable &amp; happy citizens into a state of
               civil warfare. In all the branches of the government the republicans had a decided
               majority, &amp; to aid their partizans passed laws removing sheriffs &amp; clerks of
               court from office, &amp; requiring the governor and council to appoint men to fill
               those offices. Impelled by the considerations mentioned in his speech &amp; the zeal
               of his partizans, he turned out some men from office &amp; appointed some others,
               which if left to the unbiased exercise of his own judgment it is probable he would
               not have done.</p>

            <p>On the <date>25th of April 1812</date>, in compliance with a requisition from the
               government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, he promptly issued orders to
               the militia officers to detach ten thousand men to be organized and ready to march at
               a moments warning for the defence of the country. In a private letter of that date he
               says, "We have been long enough at peace; we are loosing our spirit, our character,
               &amp; our independence. We are degenerating into a mere nation of traders, &amp; are
               forgetting the honor of our ancestors, &amp; the interest of posterity. We must be
               roused by some great event that may stir up the ancient spirit of the people. Policy
               has kept us quiet till it ceases to be policy. Weakness &amp; exhaustion prevented us
               from noble daring, &amp; it was wise in us to temporize untill we gained strength
               &amp; vigor. We have now grown to manhood, &amp; it will be shameful in the man to
               bear what the child might submit to without dishonor." At the <date>April</date>
               election this year for governor, of 104,156 votes he had 51,326, but the opposing
               federal candidate was elected by a majority of 1,370.</p>

            <p>He possessed a sagacity, a fortitude, an inflexibility, &amp; an indefatigable
               application which few men can equal. Forming his opinions with deliberation, he
               yielded them with reluctance. Feeling the conviction arising from thorough
               investigation, it was not easy to change his results.</p>

            <p>The tenacity with which he clung to such sentiments as his judgment approved was at
               times too determined, &amp; probably obstinate. This tendency was increased by
               another, which was the weakest trait of his mind. He was habitually suspicious, &amp;
               this habit increased as he advanced in years. There was little in such a state of
               mind of the art of acquiring popularity, &amp; still less in letting it be seen. They
               who were associated with him were often oppressed with a conviction that he was
               doubtful of their sincerity, &amp; this feeling on their part, generated a state of
               things which otherwise would not have existed. It is something anomalous in the
               history of character, that an individual punctiliiously upright in his own conduct,
               should entertain so many doubts of the sincerity of others.</p>

            <p>In religion he was a liberal episcopalian-willing that those who differed from him
               should conform to their own opinions. In his temper he was naturally ardent &amp;
               impetuous; but subjected his passions to the dictates of his judgment. Belonging to
               that school of manners, which commenced under the royal government, &amp; perfected
               its pupils in the camp &amp; cabinet of the revolution, regulating the deportment
               with curtesy towards others, &amp; a personal dignity that never lost its self
               respect, lofty without arrogance, affable without familiarity, he was at all times
               &amp; under all circumstances, entitled to the character of a real gentleman.</p>

            <p>On the <date>8th of June 1812</date>, at a meeting of severty six members of
               congress, all but two of them voted to nominate him as a candidate for vice president
               of the <placeName>United States</placeName>; &amp; a committee immediately wrote him
               requesting his consent. In his letter to them, of the <date>11th</date> he consented,
               observing "That in a republic, the service of each citizen is due to the state, even
               in profound peace, &amp; much more so when the nation stands on the threshold of
               war." On the first wednerday of <date>December</date> of 217 electoral votes he had
               131, &amp; was elected; &amp; on the <date>4th March 1813</date> took the oath of
               office at his own house. He was a zealous, firm, effective supporter of the war to it
               he devoted his time &amp; all the energies of his mind. The <date>24th of May</date>,
               the first day of the session, he took his seat as presiding officer in the Senate of
               the <placeName>United States</placeName>, &amp; continued till the senate adjourned
               on the <date>2d of August</date>.</p>

            <p>As a presiding officer he was not distinguished; but he rendered great service in
               supporting the government &amp; the rights of the nation. During his residence at
                  <placeName>Washington</placeName>, the private letter he received from his
               friends, &amp; from applicants for office, were numerous. The mere reading was
               fatiguing &amp; oppressive, &amp; often deprived him of both rest &amp; exercise. He
               politely answered as many of them as he was able.</p>

            <p>There was a town in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> incorporated by his name but
               in <date>1814</date> the town petitioned legislature to change its name to
                  <placeName>Phillipstown</placeName>, alledging that <persName>Gerry</persName>
               while chief magistrate had rendered "the name itself a term of odium &amp; reproach,"
               "&amp; requesting that it might no longer bear his hateful name." That a town should
               use such virulent language against a man strictly honest &amp; the second officer in
               the government of the nation, &amp; that the legislature should so far approve of it
               as to grant their request, can be imputed only to the blindness &amp; madness of
               party spirit, which then prevailed in both. Such proceedings reflect more distance on
               the petitioners &amp; the legislature, than reproach on Mr
               <persName>Gerry</persName>.</p>

            <p>Mr <persName>Gerry</persName> attended the second &amp; third sessions of the Senate;
               and on the <date>22nd of November 1814</date> provided during the whole of a long
               debate, with his usual spirit, &amp; in the enjoyment of accustomed health. On
               returning to his lodgings he complained of slight indisposition, but amused himself
               thro the evening in arranging the letters of the day, &amp; in a cheerful
               conversation with the immates of the house. He conversed about his family in
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, &amp; taking from his bosom a miniature,
               which was always suspended round his neck when the original was absent, &amp; had
               hitherto, with a peculiar delicacy of feeling, been his own personal secret, he spoke
               of it with an interest which shew that altho the surpassing beauty delineated on the
               picture might have first charmed the imagination, more enduring qualities had left
               the impress of affection on his heart.</p>

            <p>He rested well thro the night, &amp; breakfasted as usual with the family on the
               morning of the <date>23rd</date>, &amp; altho he spoke of some vague indications of
               disease, he did not consider them sufficient to prevent his taking his seat in the
               Senate, at the hour in which it was to meet. The carriage coming to cany him to the
               capitol rather earlier than usual, he directed the coachman on his way there, to stop
               at the office of the register of the treasury, at which he had some business that
               required his attention. This being arranged he returned to his carriage, &amp; had
               proceeded but a short distance, when a sudden extravasation of blood took place upon
               the lungs, &amp; terminated his life in twenty minutes, almost without a struggle,

               1814</date>, on his way to the capitol as president of the Senate, aged seventy
               years. Thus fulfilling his own memorable injunction. It is the duty of every man, tho
               he may have but one day to live, to devote that day to the good of his country.</p>
